# Image Enhancer
This program allows users to apply filters to images with the ability to undo and redo them. The user can also choose to save the filtered image. The default image is an aeroplane view of the University of
Washington campus, but any other image may be used. This is based on the ```SaveImage.java``` tutorial demo from ```Oracle.com```.
